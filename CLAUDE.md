## Tech stack
- **Next.js 15** (App Router) · **React 18** · **TypeScript 5** · **Tailwind 3**
- **framer-motion** (animation), **zod** (validation), **@vercel/analytics** +
  **@vercel/speed-insights** (telemetry)
- Package manager: **pnpm**. Font: JetBrains Mono (next/font).

## Project structure
- `src/app/` — routes (App Router): `/`, `/about`, `/services`, `/work`,
  `/work/[slug]`, `/process`, `/insights`, `/contact`, plus `api/contact` (the
  contact-form handler) and SEO routes (`sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`,
  `opengraph-image.tsx`).
- `src/components/` — UI components (header, footer, project-card, project-thumb,
  contact-form, select, etc.).
- `src/content/` — **all site copy/data as typed TS**: `site.ts` (name, domain,
  email, whatsapp, locations), `portfolio.ts` (projects + the `SHOTS` set in
  `project-thumb.tsx` controls which have real screenshots), `team.ts`,
  `services.ts`, `process.ts`, `insights.ts`, `values.ts`. Edit content here,
  not in JSX.
- `src/lib/` — `contact-schema.ts` (zod schema + project-brief option lists),
  `seo.ts`, `utils.ts`.
- `public/` — assets. Logo: `public/trustcode-systems-logo.png`. Icon:
  `public/icon.svg`. Team photos: `public/team/`. Project screenshots:
  `public/work/<slug>.png`. Business cards: `business-cards/`.
- `scripts/` — generators (`make_cards.py`, `make_whatsapp_assets.ps1`); output
  to `output/` (gitignored-style scratch).

## Commands
- `pnpm dev` — local dev server
- `pnpm build` — production build (the real CI gate; **always run before
  committing** since there is no ESLint config wired up)
- `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`
- There is **no working `pnpm lint`** (next lint prompts interactively / not
  configured). Rely on `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm build`.

## Repo & deployment
- **GitHub:** `Trust-Code-System/trustcode-system-website` (remote `origin`;
  formerly named `trustcode-systems`) — **this is the repo Vercel deploys
  from**. A separate repo `Trust-Code-System/TrustCode-System` also exists (the
  `tcs` remote) but is **not** the deploy source; don't push there expecting a
  deploy.
- **Default/production branch:** `main`. Vercel auto-deploys on push to `main`.
- `main` has branch protection (PR + "validate" status check required) but the
  owner pushes directly with bypass. Commits made in this repo are co-authored
  per the harness footer.
- **DNS** for `trustcodesystem.tech` is managed in **Vercel** (nameservers
  `ns1/ns2.vercel-dns.com`). The domain is **not** registered at Namecheap.

## Environment / dev notes
- Dev OS is **Windows**; prefer PowerShell. pnpm/Next may need
  `$env:PATH = "$env:APPDATA\npm;$env:PATH"`. Git Bash can mis-resolve the
  Next binary, so run builds via PowerShell.
- Git warns LF→CRLF on commit; harmless.
- Contact form posts to `/api/contact`, which sends mail via **Resend** (env:
  `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL`, `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`). Without
  `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` it falls back to `site.email` (hello@trustcodesystem.tech).
